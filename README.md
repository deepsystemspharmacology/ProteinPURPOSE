### Summary ###
* App Name: Protein Universal Reference Publication-Originated Search Engine (PURPOSE): A cloud-based protein prioritization tool.
* Version: 1.0.0


### Dependencies ###
* R version 3 or above
* R packages: shiny, shinyjs, shinyBS, shinysky, V8, ggplot2, plotly.


### Summary of Methods ###
* Proteins are prioritized by the Protein Universal Reference Publication-Originated Search Engine (PURPOSE), defined as
(1 + log10(nTP) + log10((Sum(Cit/yr)+1)/10)) * (1 + log10(nU/nT) + log10(nU/nP)),
where nTP is the number of PubMed publication related to both the protein and topic (TP), Cit/yr is the sum of the annualized number of citation of TP, nU is the number of PubMed publication, nT is the number of publication regarding the topic of interest, and nP is the number of publication regarding the protein of interest.

* The number of PubMed publications and citations are retrieved by eSummary tools, and the platform is implemented in Java and R.
